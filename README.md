# LinkedList

In this assignemnt I built a single linked list class. The class has data memembers head, tail, and numItems. I wrote member functions such as, push_front, push_back, pop_front, pop_back,
font, back, empty, insert, remove, and even find. Those performed the same operations as the corresponding functions. 

The second part of the assignment was creating an employee class. In the class it askes for information such as professional vs non-professional, salary,
hourly wage, health care cotribution, vacation days.
